# Cleaned ExpW Dataset

This is a facial expression dataset with 6 labels plus neutral. Since the original ExpW dataset is really dirty to some extend, here I offer a cleaner version of it. The label style is using the same format of FERPLUS which you can see [here](https://github.com/microsoft/FERPlus)
